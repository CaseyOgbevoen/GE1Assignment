# Proposal
My idea for the CA is to create a marching cube audio visualiser. There would be a continuous flow of cubes marching across the screen. A new cube would be generated for each beat of the song, so as the tempo of the music increases, the cubes would be generated faster and faster. The shape and colour of the cube would be determined by the music file, the shape of the cube would be determined by the pitch and volume of the music. The cubes would get taller in response to an increase in pitch and shorter in response to a decrease in pitch. Louder audio would generate thinner cubes, while quieter audio would result in wider cubes. I could also change the colour of the cubes generated based on one of these characteristics, or I could use procedurally generated colours.
